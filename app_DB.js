        + "<p>When a designer supplies a machine with step- by-step instructions for solving a specific prob- lem, the resulting solution is unquestionably at- tributed to the designer’s ingenuity and labors. As soon as the designer furnishes the machine with instructions for finding a method of solu- tion, the authorship of the results becomes am- biguous. Whenever a mechanism is equipped with a processor capable of finding a method of ending a method of solution, the authorship of the answer probably belongs to the machine.<p>\n"
        
        + "<p>If we extrapolate this argument, eventually the machine's creativity will be as separable from the designer's initiative as our designs and actions are from the pedagogy of our grandparents.\n"

        + "<p>This discussion is not about machines that necessarily can do architecture; it is a preface to machines that can learn about architecture and perhaps even learn about learning about architec- ture. Let us call such machines orcfiitecture mo- chines; the partnership of an  architect  with  such a device is a dialogue between two intelligent systems—the man and the machine—which are capable of producing an evolutionary system.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n"
        
        + "<p>Certainly computers are formidable clerks. They perform well when told exactly how to do something and they can remove drudgery by do- ing the dull repetitious design tasks. Is that not enough? Why ask a machine to learn, to associate courses with goals, to be self-improving  and  to be ethical?</p>\n"
        
        + "<img class='david' src='imgs/img_1.jpg'>\n"
        
        + "<p>The answer is imbedded in the question. If a machine can be a self-improving evolutionary specie, it sports a better chance of making its computational and informational abilities rele- vant. Most computer-aided design studies are ir- relevant inasmuch as they only present more fashionable and faster (though rarely cheaper) ways of doing what designers already do. And, since what designers already do does not seem to work, we will get inbred modus operandi that could make bad architecture even more prolific. The general concern of machine-assisted architecture is twofold: First, architects cannot handle large scale problems, for they are too complex; second, architects ignore small scale problems, for they are too particular and individ- ual (and, to them, trivial]. As a result of both realities, “less than 5 percent of the housing built in the United States and less than 1 percent of the urban environment is exposed to the skills of the design professions.”3 In trying to combat these deficiencies, researchers are developing infor- mation systems, computer graphics and comput- ing services that liberate the designer and allow him more time to do that which he really loves. Such efforts would be meaningful only in a con- text where machines can learn to be adaptable and learn to be relevant. (And then these efforts might be unnecessary.) Ironically, an environ- mental  humanism  might  only  be  attainable in cooperation with machines that have  been thought to be inhuman devices — devices that can intelligently respond to the tiny, individual, con- stantly changing bits of information that reflect the identity of each urbanite as well as the coherence of the city. If this is true, then the first issue is: Can  a  machine  deduce  responses  from a host of environmental data?</p>\n"

        + "<p>A 1943 theorem of McCulloch and Pitts states that a robot constructed with regenerative loops of a certain formal character is capable of deduc- ing any legitimate conclusion from a finite set of premises.’ One approach to such a faculty is to increase the probability of meaningfulness of the output (the design) generated from random or disorderly input (the criteria). Ross Ashby stated, “It has been often remarked that any random se- quence, if long enough, will contain all answers; nothing prevents  a child from doodling:  cos'  X\n"
        + "+  sin'  x  =  J .”'  In  the  same  spirit,  to paraphrase the British Museum/chimpanzee argument, a group of monkeys, while randomly doodling, can draw plans, sections and elevations of all  the great works of architecture and do this in a finite period of time. As the limiting case, we would have a tobuJ‹i ros‹i realized as a network of un- committed design components (or uncommitted primates). Unfortunately, in this process, our protagonists will have built Levittown, Lincoln Center and the New York Port Authority Towers. Surely some constraint and discrimination is necessary if the components are to converge on solutions    with  reasonable   time.	Components must assume some original commitment. As ex- amples, five particular subassemblies would be part of an architecture machine: 1) a heuristic mechanism, 2) a rote apparatus, 3) a conditioning device, 4) a reward selector and 5) a forgetting convenience...</p>\n"

        +"<p class=legend>Coral, as we experience it, is not an organism in itself, but rather a system of interactions between varius species</p>\n"
        
        +"<p>At a cellular level, Margulis first explored this in The Origin of Eukaryotic Cells <sup>[2]</sup>arguing that even the existence of nucleated cells is the product of symbiotic exchange over time. This was an elaboration of hypotheses from Schimper, Mereschkowsky, Wallin and others from earlier in the 20th century, suggesting that the organelles that distinguish eukaryote cells evolved from the symbiosis of individual single-celled prokaryotes. Margulis argued that mitochondria, plastids, and other eukaryotic organelles may represent formerly independent prokaryotes that were absorbed over one billion years ago. At fundamental levels of life, it is a shift to think of the ecosystem as evolving not strictly through mutation, but through cooperation and interaction between species.</p>\n"
        
        +"<p>This scales up, of course. The forest ecologist Suzanne Simard frames trees as “stands” -- the part of a vast mycorrhizal network that is visible to humans. The action, in Simard’s worldview, is not in how any tree grows, but rather how it interacts with the other trees (e.g., transmitting carbon to one another) and the ways that it interacts with the fungal threads below ground. Simard’s research reveals that the fungal threads form a mycelium that infects the trees and plants, trading carbon for nutrients. Each tree, in Margulis’ model, is a biont. The holobiont is the tree plus the other trees plus the mycelium, all of which keep one another alive.</p>\n"

        +"<p class=legend>The sloth, as we experience a sloth, is not an organism in itself, but rather a system of interactions between varius species</p>\n"
        
        +"<p>These symbiotic relationships extend from cells to flora to fauna; the three-toed sloth is one of the most vivid examples. Two mysteries present themselves when you consider the three-toed sloth as a species: how does it get enough food up in the trees, and why does it foolishly descend to the ground in order to defecate? To answer these questions, you need to examine the sloth holobiont, which includes the pyralid moths that infest its fur. The moths feed on the sloth’s secretions, and are in turn eaten by the sloth (providing the sloth with nutrients it cannot gain otherwise). When the sloth descends to poop, what it’s really doing is giving the moths on its skin access to the dung, so that these moths can lay eggs within it. When the eggs hatch, those moths will infest the sloth on the next trip down the tree, and so on.</p>\n"
        
        +"<p>Symbiotic exchange is true for all organisms at all scales, in varying degrees. As humans, we are only beginning to consider the vast empire of other organisms that live within us: 10,000 different species in any given gut, helping to shape our experience of the world for a day, or a lifetime. When science promised that sequencing the human genome would unlock certain mysteries of human existence, it turns out that — of course — who we really are is the interaction between our own genetic material and the genes of the different species that live inside us. We ourselves are now understood to be “bimolecular networks,” the collective genomic content of a host and its microbiome.</p>\n"
        
        +"<p>Like heliocentrism and evolution, reframing humans as holobionts is a challenge to the privilege not just of the individual, but to the notion of species. What if being human is about being much more than homo sapiens? What if obesity is not about willpower or discipline, but rather about the interactions between our own species and many others? The same goes for depression, anxiety, autism and memory loss. Have we erred by defining the human experience with too great a bias on our own species?</p>\n"
        
        +"<p>Margulis was concerned with reframing the scientist’s worldview in terms of symbiotic exchanges. But far beyond the biologist’s view, this framework that is shifting how we see the rest of the world: at large, to scale, and in its tiniest minutiae. Cities can be viewed through this lens, as can the notion of culture. It doesn’t just remove the individual from the center; it also removes the idea of the center...</p>\n"
